        <p>You should travel, you should learn, you should fall, fall and  get up.
          and the best thing ? You don't even have to do it in that order.
          Just do it.
        </p>
        <p>I currently wear many hats but the largest of one is that of an <a href="https://cerebrnita.com">academic</a> where I am truly blessed to work with an absolutely spectacular set of <a href="https://cerebrnita.com/group.html">people</a> . Broadly speaking I work in the fields of Chemistry, Mathematics and computer science. Recently I am fascinated with the interface of AI and game theory. 
</p>

        <p>Before being an academic I had the pleasure of various odd end jobs such as : CTO, derivative trade in APAC, quant on wall street in hedge funds and high frequency trading, data scientist in healthcare, Quantum hardware designer and a few other odds and ends.
</p>
        <p>I was furniture to live in: Shanghai, Amsterdam, Nijmegen, London, New York, Boston, San Francisco, Boulder, Tel Aviv, Haifa. 
</p>
<p>When I am not in front of the computer, I usually travel a lot and recently took a camera and started actually taking photos of those places.
